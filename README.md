# Incident Handler’s Journal – Ransomware Attack Analysis

This project is part of the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate. It demonstrates the ability to document a security incident using an Incident Handler’s Journal, capture the key facts of the event, and record investigative details using the 5 W’s. Documentation is a critical part of the incident response lifecycle.

## 📝 Project Description
In this activity, I documented a ransomware security incident involving a small U.S. healthcare clinic. Using the Incident Handler’s Journal, I captured the timeline of events, attacker method, impact to the organization, and contributing factors. I also recorded observations and additional notes, following industry-standard documentation practices for incident response.

## 🔍 Scenario Summary
A ransomware attack occurred at a small healthcare clinic around **9:00 a.m. on Tuesday**.  
Employees were unable to access patient data or essential systems because files were encrypted. A ransom note appeared on multiple machines stating that an organized cybercriminal group had encrypted company data and demanded payment for a decryption key.

The attack originated from **phishing emails** containing malicious attachments. After the malware executed, ransomware spread through the network, encrypting critical files and halting business operations.
